	\begin{song}[Mad World]
		<v><Em>All around me are <G>familiar faces
		<D>Worn out places, <A>worn out faces
		Bright and early for their daily races
		Going nowhere, going nowhere
			
		Their tears are filling up their glasses
		No expression, no expression
		Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
		No tomorrow, no tomorrow

		<ch><Em>And I find it kinda <A>funny
		I find it kinda <Em>sad
		The dreams in which I'm <A>dying
		Are the best I've ever <Em>had
		I find it hard to tell you
		I find it hard to take
		When people run in circles
		It's a very, very mad world, mad world

		<v>Children waiting for the day they feel good
		Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
		And I feel the way that every child should
		Sit and listen, sit and listen

		Went to school and I was very nervous
		No one knew me, no one knew me
		Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
		Look right through me, look right through me

		<ch>
